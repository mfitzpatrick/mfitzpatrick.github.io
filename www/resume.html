				<p>With Forge I took on the system architect and technical lead role in development for the Flame Detector product. I worked closely with key company stakeholders to fully understand and develop the system requirements in alignment with the business&rsquo; needs, and lead a small team of developers to convert that system design into a well-polished product that was ready for sale.
I also took on a sysadmin role for the business&rsquo; internal operations, including devops and staff productivity, and its cloud services infrastructure.</p>

				<p>My volunteer time with the SES has been very rewarding. I have spent countless hours through SES assisting my community in times of disaster, and in this time I have learnt the value of high quality leadership and teamwork.

				<aside>2012-11-24 → 2025-04-21</aside>
				<p>I started with VMR Southport on a duty crew roster performing a 24-hour shift once every 3 weeks. During my time there I performed numerous rescues of members of the boating public who were in distress. I worked my way up through the internally-managed training system to achieve my nationally-recognised Commercial Coxswain certificate, and through the internal rank system to Offshore Skipper. In 2020 I took on the Duty Skipper role to lead and manage the duty crew shift.
During my time with VMR I learned many invaluable boating skills, as well as making effective dynamic risk assessments, conflict resolution, and personnel management.</p>

				<p>Risk assessment and management • People management • Conflict resolution • Resilience • Safe vessel operation • Commercial Coxswain</p>
